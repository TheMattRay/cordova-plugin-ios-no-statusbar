# iOS Remove Status Bar

This plugin set UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance to false in *-Info.plist file
to prevent that annoying thing from reappearing if you have to add/remove platform

## Installation

`$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/TheMattRay/cordova-plugin-ios-no-statusbar.git`
